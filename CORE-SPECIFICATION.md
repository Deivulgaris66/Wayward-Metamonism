# Wayward Metamonism
## Core Specification v1.0

Wayward Metamonism is an analytical framework for describing regimes of organization and transition.

It does not claim ontological mechanisms.
It provides structural constraints for disciplined description.

---

## 1. Status

This document defines the stabilized configuration of the framework (v1.0).

The exploratory research program continues separately in the Metamonism repository.

---

## 2. Axiomatic Core

### A0. Difference as Invariant

Difference is the minimal invariant of description.

---

### A1. Non-Realizability of Absolutes

Absolute symmetry and complete self-identity are not realized as actual states.

---

### A2. Regime-Based Stability

Any stable configuration is a temporary regime of organization.

Stability is scale-dependent.

---

### A3. Non-Isolation

Complete isolation is not realizable.

Every regime participates in exchange.

---

### A4. Scale Recursion

Transitions between regimes are described as scale shifts and structural reorganization.

No identical return is assumed.

---

## 3. Structural Interpretation

- Space: articulation of organized difference.
- Time: tempo of actualization.
- Localization: regime of stabilized difference.
- Transition: reconfiguration without loss of invariant.

---

## 4. Methodological Constraint

The framework operates descriptively.

It avoids:
- ontological substance claims
- final explanatory closure
- absolute stabilization

---

## 5. Minimal Formula

Reality is described as organized difference
through regime transitions
under the non-realizability of absolute symmetry.
