# Wayward Metamonism

Wayward Metamonism is a stabilized analytical framework that emerged from the Metamonism research program.

It is not a physical theory and does not claim hidden ontological mechanisms.
It provides a minimal structural language for describing regimes of organization and transition.

## Status

This repository contains the current stabilized configuration of the framework (v1.0).

The ongoing exploratory research program remains in the original repository:

Metamonism (Research Program):
https://github.com/Deivulgaris66/Metamonism

The research program may introduce revisions to this framework through versioned updates.

## Core Principles

1. **Difference as invariant**  
   Difference is the minimal invariant of description.

2. **Non-realizability of absolutes**  
   Absolute symmetry and complete self-identity are not realized as actual states.

3. **Regime-based stability**  
   Any stable structure is a temporary regime of organization.

4. **Non-isolation**  
   Complete isolation is not realizable; every regime participates in exchange.

5. **Scale recursion**  
   Transitions are described as scale shifts without identical return.

## Methodological Position

Wayward Metamonism operates through structural isomorphisms between regimes rather than through ontological substance claims.

It is a framework for analysis, not a doctrine.
