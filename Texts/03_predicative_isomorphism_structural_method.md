## Abstract

This paper establishes predicative isomorphism as the methodological core of Metamonism. Rather than beginning with entities or substances, the framework analyzes structural predicates and their admissibility regimes across domains. Three minimal predicates are identified—Differentiation (Diff), Fixation (Fix), and Symmetry (Sym)—and their irreducibility and sufficiency are demonstrated. Nothingness is defined not as absence but as a limit-domain characterized by Diff = 0, maximal Fix, and maximal Sym. From divergences in admissibility follow the instability of fixation, the structural necessity of recursion (Rec), and the inevitability of dissipation (Diss). Metamonism thus offers not answers to classical ontological questions, but a new way of posing them — through predicate admissibility and structural isomorphism.

## 1. Methodological Shift: From Entities to Predicate Admissibility

Classical ontology asks: **What exists?**  
Metamonism asks: **Which predicates are admissible?**

This shift is decisive.  
Instead of debating ontological status of entities, we analyze the structural conditions under which predicates such as stability or identity are admissible for configurations of differentiation.

The methodological procedure consists of four steps:

1. Identify structural predicates.  
2. Examine their admissibility regimes.  
3. Map predicative isomorphisms.  
4. Derive consequences from divergences.  

Predicative isomorphism means:  
**same predicate — different ontological status.**

## 2. Structural Predicates: Minimality and Irreducibility

We introduce three predicates:

- **Diff** — differentiation (presence of distinction)  
- **Fix** — stabilization of distinction  
- **Sym** — invariance under distinction  

These three are minimal and sufficient to distinguish all four structural domains.  
Removing any collapses the distinction between Monos, Logos, Information, and Nothingness.

Symmetry is not reducible to Diff = 0.  
It expresses invariance with respect to possible differentiations.

## 3. Domains and Their Predicate Regimes

### 3.1 Monos
Monos = continuous differentiation.

Admissibility:
- Diff: invariant  
- Fix: local  
- Sym: partial  
- Absolute identity: ontologically excluded  

Absolute identity terminates differentiation, hence process.

### 3.2 Logos
Logos operates through Diff + Fix.

Admissibility:
- Diff: operational  
- Fix: operational  
- Sym: conceptually definable  
- Absolute identity: logically definable  

### 3.3 Information
Information is stabilized identity within differentiation.

Admissibility:
- Diff: constrained  
- Fix: maintained through recursion  
- Sym: partial  
- Absolute identity: unattainable  

Information represents a stabilized cross-section of Rec₁.

### 3.4 Nothingness as Limit-Domain
Nothingness is defined as:

Diff = 0  
Fix = maximal  
Sym = maximal

It is the limit-regime of identity saturation, not absence.

## 4. Isomorphic Correspondence

| Domain        | Diff        | Fix        | Sym        | Identity Regime         |
|---------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Monos         | invariant   | local      | partial    | destabilized            |
| Logos         | operational | operational| conceptual | representational        |
| Information   | constrained | maintained | partial    | recursive               |
| Nothingness   | 0           | maximal    | maximal    | absolute                |

---

## 5. Ontological Invariant

A domain is non-limiting iff Diff > 0.

Formal statement:
∀D (NonLimiting(D) → Admissible(Diff, D))

Nothingness is the limit where Diff = 0.

---

## 6. Instability of Fix

In non-limiting domains, Fix cannot be global.  
If Fix achieved absolute stability, the domain would collapse toward Nothingness.

Thus Fix is inherently exposed to Diff.

---

## 7. Derivation of Recursion

Stabilization alternatives are exhausted:

- Static storage → unstable  
- External stabilizer → regress  
- Spontaneous persistence → undefined  

Minimal solution:
Rec = iterative self-application of Fix

Rec is dynamic re-confirmation.

---

## 8. Dissipation

Diss = Diff operating across Fix.  
It is not an added force — it is intrinsic to Monos.

---

## 9. Dynamic Condition of Structure

Structure exists when:
Rec ≥ Diss

Reality is dynamic asymmetry between Rec and Diss within Diff.

---

## 10. Recursive Hierarchy

Rec₁ = stabilization of differentiation patterns.  
Rec₂ = stabilization of prior stabilizations as operands.

Information provides substrate for Rec₂.

---

## 11. Conclusion

Metamonism offers not a new metaphysical substance, but a method of structural analysis.

Reality is structured asymmetry between Rec and Diss within Diff, bounded by the limit-regime of maximal symmetry.
