# Metamonism Method

Metamonism Method is the methodological component of Wayward Metamonism.

It provides a disciplined procedure for working with categories through structural isomorphisms rather than ontological claims.

The method does not assert what reality *is*.
It structures how regimes may be described.

---

## 1. Foundational Principle

Categories are not treated as substances.
They are treated as structurally equivalent modes of organizing difference.

The task is not to identify essences, but to detect isomorphic structures.

---

## 2. Core Operations

### 2.1 Structural Reduction

Replace substance-based claims with regime-based descriptions.

Instead of:
"What is X?"

Ask:
"In which regime of organization does X appear?"

---

### 2.2 Isomorphic Mapping

Identify structural equivalences across domains.

If two domains share:

- instability of symmetry
- regime transitions
- scale recursion
- non-isolation

they may be treated as structurally isomorphic
without asserting ontological identity.

---

### 2.3 Regime Transition Analysis

When a stable configuration shifts:

- do not search for hidden substances
- describe the transition as a scale shift or structural reorganization

---

### 2.4 Anti-Reification Discipline

Avoid transforming descriptive tools into ontological entities.

Notation (123, 4, 567, 8) is structural,
not metaphysical.

---

## 3. Application Domains

The method may be applied to:

- physics (phase transitions, localization regimes)
- cosmology (scale recursion)
- biology (metastability and adaptation)
- cognition (recursive self-reference)
- social systems (structural instability and reorganization)

The method remains domain-neutral.

---

## 4. Methodological Constraints

1. No absolute stabilization.
2. No appeal to hidden substances.
3. No claims of final explanatory closure.
4. All stabilization is versioned and provisional.

---

## 5. Minimal Formula

Reality is described through regime organization of difference.

The method operates by identifying structural isomorphisms
and mapping transitions without reifying them.
