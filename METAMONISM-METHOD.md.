# Metamonism Method

Metamonism Method is the methodological component of **Wayward Metamonism**.

It provides a disciplined procedure for working with categories through structural isomorphisms rather than ontological assertions.

The method does not state what reality *is*.  
It defines how structural regimes may be analyzed.

---

## 1. Foundational Orientation

Categories are not treated as substances.  
They are treated as structurally equivalent modes of organizing difference.

The task is not to identify essences, but to detect invariant predicates and map their admissibility across domains.

Metamonism replaces the question:

> “What exists?”

with:

> “Which structural predicates are admissible in this regime?”

A formal implementation of this methodological shift is presented in:

**Myshko, A. (2026). _Predicative Isomorphism as Structural Method._**  
Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18816117  

That paper demonstrates how structural predicates (Diff, Fix, Sym) generate regime differentiation without reification.

## 2. Core Operations

### 2.1 Structural Reduction

Replace substance-based claims with regime-based descriptions.

Instead of:

> “What is X?”

Ask:

> “Under which regime of organization does X appear?”  
> “Which predicates are admissible in that regime?”

This prevents ontological inflation and redirects inquiry toward structural conditions.

---

### 2.2 Predicative Isomorphism

Identify structural equivalences across domains.

Two domains may be treated as structurally isomorphic if they share:

- admissibility patterns of differentiation (Diff)
- local stabilization (Fix)
- symmetry conditions (Sym)
- recursive reinforcement
- instability under dissipation

Isomorphism does not imply ontological identity.  
It indicates structural correspondence under differing regimes.

---

### 2.3 Regime Transition Analysis

When a stable configuration shifts:

- do not search for hidden substances
- do not posit external causes as metaphysical grounds
- describe the transition as a reconfiguration of predicate admissibility

Transitions are structural reorganizations, not ontological replacements.

---

### 2.4 Recursive Stabilization

Stability is not assumed; it must be structurally supported.

Fix cannot become global in non-limiting regimes.

Stable configurations persist only through recursive reinforcement (Rec) and are exposed to dissipation (Diss).

Thus, the method treats stability as dynamic asymmetry, not equilibrium.

---

### 2.5 Anti-Reification Discipline

Descriptive tools must not be converted into ontological entities.

Notation systems (e.g., 123, 4, 567, 8) are structural indexing devices, not metaphysical claims.

Conceptual clarity requires constant vigilance against reification.

---

## 3. Application Domains

The method is domain-neutral and scale-invariant.

It may be applied to:

- physics (phase transitions, localization regimes)
- cosmology (scale recursion and structural gradients)
- biology (metastability and adaptive cycles)
- cognition (recursive self-reference)
- social systems (structural instability and reorganization)

The method does not depend on domain-specific ontology.  
It analyzes admissibility patterns across scales.

---

## 4. Methodological Constraints

1. No absolute stabilization in non-limiting regimes.  
2. No appeal to hidden substances.  
3. No final explanatory closure.  
4. All stabilization is provisional and versioned.  
5. Limit-regimes (e.g., maximal symmetry) are defined structurally, not mystically.

---

## 5. Minimal Formula

Reality is described through regime organization of difference.

The method operates by:

- identifying minimal structural predicates,
- mapping admissibility regimes,
- detecting isomorphisms,
- analyzing recursive stabilization and dissipation,
- defining limit-cases without reification.

Metamonism Method is not a metaphysical doctrine.  
It is a structural analytic procedure.
